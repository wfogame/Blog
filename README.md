 Some messy AI stuff below WARNING WARNING WARNING;;;;;;

 ## Some random things AI told me to do 
 1. Layout & Structure

Flexbox: For centering content, distributing space between buttons, and creating responsive layouts
CSS Grid: Alternative layout system for more complex arrangements
Box Model: Understanding margin, padding, border, and content areas
Positioning: Relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning

2. Advanced Selectors & Pseudo-elements

::before and ::after: Create decorative elements, backgrounds, or content without extra HTML
:hover, :focus, :active: Interactive states for buttons and links
:nth-child(): Style specific list items differently
Adjacent sibling selectors (+): Style elements that follow others

3. Background & Visual Effects

Linear and Radial Gradients: Create colorful, dynamic backgrounds
Background animations: Moving gradients, color shifts, or pattern animations
Multiple backgrounds: Layer different background effects
Background-size, background-position: Control how backgrounds display

4. Modern CSS Features

CSS Custom Properties (Variables): Store colors, sizes, and reusable values
Calc(): Mathematical calculations for responsive sizing
Clamp(): Responsive typography and spacing
CSS Filters: Blur, brightness, contrast, drop-shadow effects

5. Glassmorphism & Modern UI

backdrop-filter: Create frosted glass effects
RGBA/HSLA colors: Transparent and semi-transparent elements
Box-shadow: Create depth and elevation
Border-radius: Rounded corners and pill-shaped buttons

6. Animations & Transitions

@keyframes: Create custom animations
Transform: Scale, rotate, translate, and skew elements
Transition: Smooth changes between states
Animation properties: Duration, delay, iteration, direction, easing

7. Typography & Content Styling

Font loading: Web fonts and font-display
Text effects: Shadows, gradients, and animations
Line-height, letter-spacing: Fine-tune text appearance
Responsive typography: Fluid font sizes

8. Responsive Design

Media queries: Different styles for different screen sizes
Viewport units: vw, vh, vmin, vmax for responsive sizing
Container queries: Style based on parent container size
Flexible units: rem, em, percentages

9. Interactive Elements

Button styling: Remove default styles, add custom appearance
Hover effects: Scale, color changes, shadow effects
Focus states: Accessibility for keyboard navigation
Active states: Feedback when clicking

10. Performance & Optimization
